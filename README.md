Write a Medium post on analyzing the structure of a Web-based network. Relevant networks or graphs include the Web graph (e.g., edges between domains or edges between articles in a single web site) or online social networks. In your analysis, define what it means for a node to be "important" and describe how you might find such a node in the graph.

Your post should include the following:

Describe a question you think can be answered using network data, what specific stakeholder is asking this question, and what decision(s) the answer to this question will inform.
Describe the data that could answer this question, what fields it contains, and why it is relevant to your question.
Explain how you collected some subset of this data (e.g., libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, tweepy, praw, etc. or from data archive).
Define what entity is represented by a node/vertex in the graph, and what relationship between these nodes does an edge represent.
Define "importance" in your graph and identify a set of at least three important nodes.
Provide an answer to your question, explaining your analysis of the data you collected, and how it answers that question.
Include figures or tables summarizing your findings. 
Describe how you cleaned up this data, common bugs you think others might encounter, and how you fixed them, etc.
Discuss the limitations of your analysis. Whatâ€™s missing? How might it be biased?
Include a link to one of your GitHub repositories that contains the code you have developed for this assignment.
When you have written your post, publish it via Medium, add your post it to the class publication via Medium, and submit the URL to it via Canvas.
